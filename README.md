# Financial Insights Chatbot with Azure OpenAI

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a **data analysis chatbot application** that leverages **Azure OpenAI Services** to extract meaningful insights from complex 10-Q financial documents. This chatbot empowers investment analysts by transforming dense, multi-page reports into accessible, conversational insights—enabling faster, more informed decision-making in high-pressure environments.

By implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and utilizing **GPT-4**, the chatbot can answer questions about financial performance, business operations, risk factors, and management commentary with precision and context-awareness.

## Project Overview

Imagine you're a data analyst at a fast-paced investment firm. Each quarter, you're handed a stack of 10-Q filings—hundreds of pages of financial data and corporate disclosures. Your task: extract key insights quickly and accurately.

This project solves that challenge by creating a smart assistant that:
- Understands complex financial language
- Retrieves relevant sections from 10-Q documents
- Provides conversational answers using Azure OpenAI's GPT-4
- Streamlines the data analysis workflow
